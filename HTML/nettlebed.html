<h1>NETTLEBED MANOR</h1>
<p>In the mid-to-late 13th century Richard, earl of Cornwall, or his son Edmund, as lords of Benson, granted an independent manor of Nettlebed to John de Mandeville (d. 1275), who was succeeded by his under-age son John. He may have been deprived, however, since in 1284 the manor was apparently included in a grant by Edmund to Rewley abbey, along with his 'whole wood at Nettlebed' and two parks called Highmoor. The abbey acquired additional small parcels from two tenants-in-chief in 1303, when Edmunds widow Margaret claimed dower in a third of its alleged 2,000 a. of wood in Nettlebed and Benson.<a href="#fn1">(fn. 1)</a> In 1362 the abbey exchanged the manor for lands in Cornwall with Edward the Black Prince (d. 1376), whose widow Joan (d. 1385) was assigned it in dower. Thereafter it reverted to the Crown and was given to Richard II's chamber knight Sir John Salisbury, executed in 1387<a href="#fn2">(fn. 2)</a>.</p>
  <p>In 1393 the manor was bestowed for life on Thomas Hatfield, a minor member of Richard II's household, and in 1414 on another royal servant, William Bangor. His life possession was confirmed in 1423 when his rent formed part of the dower awarded to Queen Catherine (d. 1437), and in 1443 Henry VI re-granted the manor in survivorship to Bangor and a royal porter,<a href="#fn3">(fn. 3)</a> John Watts. From the late 15th to the mid 16th century the Crown leased the demesne to unnamed farmers and appointed bailiffs to collect the rents, but in 1544–5 the manor was briefly granted to a London mercer, and in 1547 to Thomas Seymour, Baron Seymour of Sudeley. On his fall in 1549 it was granted to William Grey (d. 1562), Baron Grey of Wilton, and John Bannaster, for their service against the Scots.</p>
