<h1>NETTLEBED MANOR</h1>
<p>In <span class="date">the mid-to-late 13th century</span> <span class="person">Richard, earl of <span class="place">Cornwall</span></span>, or his son <span class="person">Edmund</span>, as lords of <span class="place">Benson</span>, granted an independent manor of <span class="place">Nettlebed</span> to <span class="person">John de Mandeville</span> (d. <span  class="date">1275</span>), who was succeeded by his under-age son <span class="person">John</span>. He may have been deprived, however, since in <span class="date">1284</span> the manor was apparently included in a grant by <span class="person">Edmund</span> to <span class="institution">Rewley abbey</span>, along with his 'whole wood at <span class="place">Nettlebed</span>' and two parks called Highmoor. The abbey acquired additional small parcels from two tenants-in-chief in <span class="date">1303</span>, when <span class="person">Edmunds</span> widow <span class="person">Margaret</span> claimed dower in a third of its alleged 2,000 a. of wood in <span class="place">Nettlebed</span> and <span class="place">Benson</span>.<a href="#fn1">(fn. 1)</a> In <span class="date">1362</span> the abbey exchanged the manor for lands in <span class="place">Cornwall</span> with <span class="person">Edward the Black Prince</span> (d. <span class="date">1376</span>), whose widow <span class="person">Joan</span> (d. <span class="date">1385</span>) was assigned it in dower. Thereafter it reverted to the Crown and was given to <span class="person">Richard II</span>'s chamber knight <span class="person">Sir John Salisbury</span>, executed in <span class="date">1387</span><a href="#fn2">(fn. 2)</a>.</p>
  <p>In <span class="date">1393</span> the manor was bestowed for life on <span class="person">Thomas Hatfield</span>, a minor member of <span class="person">Richard II</span>'s household, and in <span class="date">1414</span> on another royal servant, <span class="person">William Bangor</span>. His life possession was confirmed in <span class="date">1423</span> when his rent formed part of the dower awarded to <span class="person">Queen Catherine</span> (d. <span class="date">1437</span>), and in <span class="date">1443</span> <span class="person">Henry VI</span> re-granted the manor in survivorship to <span class="person">Bangor</span> and a royal porter,<a href="#fn3">(fn. 3)</a> <span class="person">John Watts</span>. From the late 15th to the mid 16th century the Crown leased the demesne to unnamed farmers and appointed bailiffs to collect the rents, but in <span class="date">1544</span>–5 the manor was briefly granted to <span class="person">a London mercer</span>, and in <span class="date">1547</span> to <span class="person">Thomas Seymour, Baron Seymour of Sudeley</span>. On his fall in <span class="date">1549</span> it was granted to <span class="person">William Grey</span> (d. <span class="date">1562</span>), <span class="person">Baron Grey of Wilton</span>, and <span class="person">John Bannaster</span>, for their service against the Scots.</p>
